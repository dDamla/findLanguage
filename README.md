# findLanguage
This is a java project to find the language of a text or a wikipedia page. (Turkish, English or German)

Note1: If you learn a text's language, you can give a text that have 50 different words to this program.
Note2: This program gets 30 wikipedia pages from web to specify the languages. So it works slowly.
